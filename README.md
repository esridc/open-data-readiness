# open-data-readiness

The Open Data Readiness Diagnostic is a guide upon which governments can assess their readiness to implement a successful open data solution. Open data is simple to implement using familiar and streamlined workflows, is provided from operational services through a consistent and discoverable user experience, and can be successful at no cost.

The pages within this repo house content for different parts of the diagnostic: 
* [Introduction](https://github.com/esridc/open-data-readiness/blob/master/intro.md)
* [Critical Factors for Successful Open Geospatial Data](https://github.com/esridc/open-data-readiness/tree/master/success-factors)
  * [Beforehand](https://github.com/esridc/open-data-readiness/blob/master/success-factors/beforehand.md)
  * [Implementation](https://github.com/esridc/open-data-readiness/blob/master/success-factors/implementation.md)
  * [Beyond the portal](https://github.com/esridc/open-data-readiness/blob/master/success-factors/beyond.md)
* [Case Studies](https://github.com/esridc/open-data-readiness/blob/master/case-studies.md)
