# open-data-readiness

The Open Data Readiness Diagnostic is a guide upon which governments can assess their readiness to implement a successful open data solution. Open data is simple to implement using familiar and streamlined workflows, is provided from operational services through a consistent and discoverable user experience, and can be successful at no cost.

The pages within this repo house content for different parts of the diagnostic:
