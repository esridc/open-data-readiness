## Beyond the Portal 

An open data initiative doesn’t stop with an open data site — putting the data in the open is only useful if people actually use it and generate the benefits discussed in the first section of this assessment. After the portal is implemented there are many things governments should be doing to ensure their open data initiative reaches its full potential. 

### Usage Analytics 

Tracking usage analytics of a site enables administrators to gain more insight regarding how their data portal is being used, and offers opportunities to identify where efforts should be focused going forward. 

**Health**

Administrators can track metrics to measure the ‘health’ of usage, monitor the growth of the initiative, and track return on investment. These numbers help quantify the utility of an open data program and help lead to its sustainability. 

Metrics are built in to ArcGIS Open Data - administrators can track the number of site sessions, dataset views, dataset downloads, and more. 

**Optimization**

Analytics also shed insight to where users are spending their time, which datasets they are accessing and exploring, which formats they are downloading, and what datasets they search for. Knowing what the common search terms are allows administrators to devote efforts to creating datasets that fulfill users needs. Admins can also use this information to better categorize their datasets on the site homepage so users can quickly access what they are looking for. 


### Civic Engagement 

City governments must connect with their community to ensure their open data initiative is effective and sustainable. Meeting with the users of the data is the best way to ensure your data is meeting their needs. There are great examples of ways governments are creating spaces for these connections and meeting communities where they are to create a two-way conversation surrounding open data. 

**Hosting Events**

Hosting events is a fantastic way to raise awareness of an open data initiative and the vast quantities of data that are now available for use. Cities can host hackathons, contests, and office hours to help spur and support the use of open data, and will prompt the community to get involved. 

These events are a good opportunity to get feedback from users about their experiences with the open data site and the available data. 

**Attending Events**

Lots of cities have thriving civic technology scenes. Attending and speaking at these kind of meet ups will raise awareness of the open data available and will provide use cases for particular groups. 

Getting in touch with a local [Code for America brigade](https://www.codeforamerica.org/brigade/), if present, will put the data at the forefront of civic hacking. These groups have the technical skills and the field knowledge to turn data into services and information that the greater community can use. 

**Local Organizations and Schools**

Connecting with local start-up incubators and schools will extend the reach of the data. Connecting with incubators will provide local start ups with high quality, authoritative data that can be used to stimulate economic development. Connecting with schools is a great opportunity to get open data in the classroom and in the hands of students. Universities and schools can access the data for assignments to create meaningful projects about the community they live in.
