**Beyond the portal**

**Usage analytics**
* **Health**: administrators can track metrics to measure the 'health' of usage and monitor the growth of the initiative, track ROI, etc.
* **Identification**: metrics can help identify where to improve the data and the site, and where to invest time. 

**Internal use**
* **Lower barriers**: encouraging internal use of the open data site will minimize barriers for data sharing between departments and will save time and resources.

**Civic engagement**
* **Hosting events**: governments with the capacity to host hackathons, office hours, and contests will help spur and support the use of open data and will prompt the community to get involved. 
* **Going to events**: governments that are involved with current civic tech scene in their community can raise awareness of open data and provide use cases for particular groups.
* **Local organizations**: sponsoring local incubators can stimulate economic development using open data. 
* **Schools**: open data can be used in the classroom by coordinating with schools involved in the ConnectED program (every K-12 school in the US). Universities can access the data for research projects, and can create their own site to share curriculum data if they have an ArcGIS subscription.
