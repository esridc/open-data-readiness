**Implementation**
* Technical ecosystem, skills 
   * ArcGIS Online subscription
   * supported server 
   * data imports using koop - have a consistent experience accessing data from multiple APIs
   * ArcGIS Server has a common API across all services - koop provides option to bring other data into that ecosystem
   * design 
* Data management, procedures, availability (checklist?) 
   * federation across departments 
        * groups can manage their own data and have their own site
        * federating data from these groups into a common site
        * workflow of staging groups and sites for quality assurance
   * user roles so someone oversees data quality 
   * high impact datasets - parcels, crime, census, building footprints, addresses 
   * high quality datasets - licensing, metadata 
   * multiple sites for different departments (transportation site, planning site, education site)
