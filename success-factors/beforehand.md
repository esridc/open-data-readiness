**Beforehand**

**Leadership**
* Senior Support: having a senior staffer vouch for the implementation of the open data initiative will help overcome any resistances that may arise.
* Institutional Support: sustainable institutional support will help ensure the open data initiative is upheld beyond a single administration.
* Project leader: an open data specialist is not necessary for success -- open data is part daily processes that can easily be exposed to the public. An effective initiative should have a project leader(s) from within the GIS or IT department that has an understanding of the data and policies and can leverage existing data and services.

**Policies and Legal**   
* Existing policies: governments may have policies surrounding FOIA requests that can be used for data that requires sanitization. The open data initiative can leverage existing workflows that will aid in publishing open data, if needed.
* Licensing: choosing a standard license helps users understand any limitations associated with the data. Terms and Conditions pages can be cumbersome to the data user -- a Creative Commons license applied across all data is easily recognized and understood.
* Sustainability: documenting policies, workflows, and licensing helps ensure the longevity of the initiative as governments see employee and administrative turnover.

**Financial** 
* Platform: exposing open data in a consistent, accessible, and explorable manner doesn't cost anything. Publication is part of normal operations and the platform does not require any extra budgeting -- it's free.
* Personnel and programs: any funds dedicated for open data can be driven towards staff for community support and development of outreach programs.

**Institutional structures and capabilities**
* GIS department: most data is geospatial-- the open data initiative can be led by the GIS department, who has decades of experience with data management, service infrastructures, and analysis.
* Grassroots beginnings: starting with existing data and services from within the GIS department is a quick and easy way to kickstart the open data initiative
* Departmental coordination: data will likely be coming from many sources. Coordination amongst the GIS department and other departments in terms of data formats and workflows will help consistency.
* Beyond GIS: distributed workflows can help the open data initiative grow beyond the GIS department, and other departments can work to publish their own data straight to the open data site.

**Demand for open data**
* Citizen engagement: if citizens are consistently asking for data and submitting FOIA requests, the open data initiative can expect to see immediate use and success.
* Data-driven economic development: communities where companies are using public and open data to create services will cater to a wider demographic.
* Internal use: open data will satisfy the needs of internal data sharing, which increases government efficiency.
