## Beforehand

There are several things to consider before launching an open data initiative, and many ways to assess how successful your open data initiative may be once launched. 

### Leadership 
A successful project must have some sort of leader. While an open data specialist is not necessary for success, having senior support and someone (or a group of people) within a GIS department to spearhead the initiative will help get it off the ground, and institutional support will contribute to its sustainability and longevity. 

**Senior Support**

Having a senior staffer vouch for the implementation of the open data initiative will help overcome any resistances that may arise. Governments may or may not experience a change in workflows, and senior support will help incentivize any actors that need to make any changes in a timely and effective manner.

Senior support is proven when a government has issued a political promise or policy position on open data, open government, or FOI, and visible champions exist for open data at a political level. It’s beneficial if there are existing activities related to open data and open government — if the idea of open data is already generally known and supported within the government, an initiative is more likely to have support and interest, and will lead to success. 

**Institutional Support**

Sustainable institutional support will help ensure the open data initiative is upheld beyond a single administration. Government initiatives may be pressured to produce results within an administration period, and it may be difficult to prove ROI on a well-planned open data initiative in that short time. It is essential to ensure that a change in government will not jeopardize the existence and maintenance of the program. 

Open data should be supported in the broader political context of the government and have commitments across the political spectrum. An initiative is most likely to succeed if a government’s stated priorities and goals align with open data across any political divides and administrations. 

**Project Lead**

Governments don’t need to hire people specifically to manage and oversee open data programs; open data is part of daily processes that can easily be exposed to the public by adding a couple steps to already existing workflows. 

It is best to have a project leader(s) from the GIS department who can serve as a point of contact. This point of contact should have an understanding of the data and policies, and can leverage existing data and services to get the project off the ground quickly. 

### Policies and Legal 
Governments must delineate certain policies and legal frameworks in which an open data initiative will operate to serve the city and its citizens. In many cases there are existing policies that can be applied to open data, in others, new policies must be developed. It is critical that all of these policies and frameworks are documented clearly for the long-term success and sustainability of the program — this also helps contribute to institutional support in the Leadership category. 

**Existing Policies**

It is very likely that governments have applicable policies that already exist. These policies, where appropriate, can be applied to reduce overhead and enable the initiative to be launched more quickly. 

Governments with existing Freedom of Information policies can take relevant components and apply them to their open data initiatives, for example, processes for data that requires sanitization. If governments have a track record of releasing information requested using the FOI mechanisms, they are likely already set up well to release open data. Privacy policies are also necessary for data anonymization in FOI requests, and should be used when preparing open data where applicable. 

**Licensing**

A key component of an open data initiative is establishing under which license the data will be published. This makes users aware of any use constraints bestowed upon the data and allows governments to know how their data is being used. 

Governments may have pre-established terms and conditions that can be used for open datasets, however, these terms can be filled with legalese and be cumbersome to the data user. It is strongly recommended to choose a clear and concise license that is easy to understand by the users. Creative Commons has a selection of licenses that are common in the open community and have clear and accessible meanings.  

**Sustainability** 

All of the chosen policies and legal frameworks should be properly documented to ensure the longevity of the initiative as governments see employee and administrative turnover. Governments that effectively do this already are at an advantage; governments that do not include proper documentation in their processes should make the proper changes to include it. 


### Financial 

Launching and sustaining and open data initiative should not and does not have to be a large financial undertaking. Many governments already have the required technical resources and can focus devoting any available budget to personnel and programs. 

**Platform**

Exposing open data in a consistent, accessible, and explorable manner through ArcGIS Open Data is a functionality included in ArcGIS Online subscriptions — for most governments that already have this subscription, launching open data is free. Publication is part of normal, daily operations and the platform does not require any extra budgeting. 

**Personnel and Programs**

Ensuring an open data program is effective does take some personnel resources to ensure data quality, support, and outreach. If governments have funds dedicated for an open data initiative, they can be driven towards staff for community support and development of outreach programs. This focus on the user and the communities will help ensure that users are being properly served and have the data they need.

### Institutional structures and capabilities

Governments need to be equipped to handle data management for the open data initiative. Clearly defined processes for data gathering, staging and quality control, and publication are essential. Most data is geospatial in nature and lots of data is already available within governments to immediately release. Once initiated, programs can and should grow beyond the GIS department.  

**GIS Department**

People in the GIS department have been dealing with data management, service infrastructures, and analysis for decades. It makes sense for this department to begin the initiative with the data they are most familiar with. 

Governments with a GIS department that is experienced using ArcGIS Server and ArcGIS Online can quickly get their open data program off the ground with a few button clicks. Using existing data and services is a great way to kickstart the initiative — commence with grassroots beginnings and work upwards.

**Departmental Coordination Beyond GIS**

Data will likely be coming from many sources and across many departments — transportation, planning, etc. Coordination amongst the GIS department and other departments in terms of data formats and workflows will help consistency. 

Departments should follow policies and frameworks that were previously delineated to maintain standards. If all departments are supportive of the program, users will benefit from the most data available. Distributed workflows can help the open data initiative grow beyond the GIS department, and other departments can work to publish their own data straight to the open data site. 

### Demand for Open Data 

If there is a current demand for open data that a new open data program will meet, then it will likely see immediate use and its effectiveness will be jumpstarted. The demand for open data can come from the external community or from inside government.

**External Community**

The external community can include citizens seeking data for personal and non-profit use, as well as companies seeking data for use in businesses and services. 

A city that has an already engaged community who consistently ask for data and who submit FOI requests can expect to see immediate use and success. These users will have a new resource full of accessible data in multiple open formats for use in civic projects and for personal use. If a city has companies that are using public and open data to create services, their open data site will cater to a wider demographic and see multitudes of uses. 

**Internal Community**

Open data will satisfy the needs of internal data sharing, and will increase government efficiency. Departments will no longer have to request and wait for data, or field and fill data requests. 

If a government sees a lot of data sharing amongst its departments, it is likely that these departments will see the benefits of improved workflows from accessing data in a central repository.
